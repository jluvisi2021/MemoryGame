# MemoryGame
An LED Memory Game made for Arduino R3!

How it works:
- Click any button when the LCD Screen comes on.
- The RGB Led will then flash 2 times with random values. The colors it flashes will be either Red, Green, or Blue.
- You will then need to input the colors that flashed in order.
- You can cycle through the colors by pressing the (Left-Side) cycle button.
- Once you are on the color that you believe was shown you can press the (Right-Side) submit button.
- When you have repeated this for the amount of times the RGB Led flashed then the LCD will display
where you are right or wrong.
- When you have finished the pattern the game will continue to loop each time adding one more led flash you need to remember.
- There is no limit to the streaks in the game.
